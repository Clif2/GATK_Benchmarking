# GATK_Benchmarking
Example scripts for benchmarking the computational performance of GATK3.8 and GATK4.

*Baseline*
The baseline files represent original tests of GATK3.8 and the newest release of GATK4 at the time of testing, GATK4.0.1.2.

*Optimal*
The optimal files represent tests run with optimized parameters on GATK3.8 and GATK4.0.1.2.

*Split*
The split file shows an example of splitting a WGS sample into chunks for parallel processing with GATK4.0.1.2 (which does not have multithreading capabilities).
